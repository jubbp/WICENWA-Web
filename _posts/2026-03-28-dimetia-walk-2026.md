WICEN WA will support the Dimetia Walk in Perth again this year.

The walk will be held on the 29th March 2026, starting at at Burswood Park.

WICEN-WA will be present to setup, manage and monitor radio cumminications used by the event volunteers.

This includes setting up and dismantling a portable repeater, issuing hand held radios to the volunteers and providing training/support if necessary.
